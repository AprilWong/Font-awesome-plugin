#Hello
I am a simple photoshop plugin for designers to use fontawesome more friendly in photoshop, which means instead of opening cheatsheet then copy and paste, I can help you find the icons you want inside photoshop.

#How to install
//only for Creative Cloud 2014 Users

//only used as debug mode

After downloading source file, copy ./fontawesome to /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/ (If you can't find the directory, then create one. )

Then open Photoshop CC 2014, go to Window -> Extensions -> Fontawesome

Enjoy it (๑´ڡ`๑)
